                 <h2>HIRING AN EMPLOYEE VS. A CONTRACTOR?</h2>
                  <p>This is one of the common questions I get from entrepreneurs, which is totally understandable. I mean it’s a big decision and there are pros and cons for hiring both. So, it’s worth taking the time to figure out which is best for your business</p>
              
                  <p>In law, the type of employment is referred to as the employment status i.e. a contractor or employee. And it’s worth knowing upfront that your decision on the employment status does have tax implications (and we all know HMRC doesn’t like it when people try to avoid tax, even when it’s not on purpose)</p>

                    <h2>HIRING AN EMPLOYEE – HERE ARE THE PROS!</h2>
                    <h3> Commitment is both ways</h3>
                    <p>With an employee, you have someone fully dedicated to your business. Whereas when a Contractor finishes an assignment, they might not be available the next time you need them if they have other projects. You’ll likely have them with you for longer than a contractor (especially if your contractor has big ambitions for their own business). Generally employees are happy to exchange their hard work for a salary and want job security (otherwise they would be working for themselves too). </p>
                    <h3>The standards are set by you</h3>
                    <p>You can train and mould them to do things the way you want them done. You can give them feedback, performance objectives and training to ensure you are happy. A contractor may have their own way of doing things. </p>

                    <h2>BUT THERE’S A DOWNSIDE (SOME CONS)</h2>  
                    <h4> There's baggage</h4>
                    <p>And by baggage, I mean, employees have a lot of employment rights and entitlements that you don’t get with hiring a contractor. I’m talking holiday allowance, minimum wage requirements, sick pay and redundancy pay. Plus, a lot more.  </p>
                    <h4>It ain't cheap</h4>
                    <p>You’ll likely pay a lower hourly rate than a contractor, but you’ll have to offer a pension, training, benefits, sick pay (all those rights I mentioned above). You’ll also need to pay national insurance, more tax than contractor and invest in things like employers liability insurance and PAYE systems to pay them, which all add up</p>
                    <h4>It’s a big commitment </h4>
                    <p>You’ll have to pay their salary each month, regardless of how much money you make. So, you need to be confident that you can afford this. If you want to let the employee go, you need to have a good reason as the laws of England are very clear on this. The redundancy process or poor performance dismissal process need to be followed properly.  </p>
